          No matter how excited everyone is about the puppy’s arrival, keep
          their homecoming low-key. It’s so easy to shower the new dog with
          affection, particularly for the younger members of the family. While
          the new pup is getting used to their surroundings, always supervise
          excited children and give your dog some much-needed time out from all
          the excitement. Start off by having them in one room and let them
          explore in their own time discovering the scents, sights and sounds of
          this new world. Allow your puppy to settle in gradually and in their
          own time. This is far better than overwhelming them with enthusiastic
          games, cuddles and play while they are still trying to find their
          paws.

          It doesn’t take much to make a puppy feel secure and happy in their
          new life. But by just taking a step back from the excitement of
          bringing a new puppy home and realising that for them their whole
          world has changed and everything is unfamiliar, you can make their
          homecoming the fun and wonderful event that you want it to be.
